# Problem Statement:  

Using the features in dataset, develop a Random Forest regression model to predict YouTube video views. This project will uncover how engagement metrics and video categories influence viewership trends, supporting content creators, advertisers, and platform managers in making data-driven decisions to improve content performance and strategic planning.

# Project Phases: 

1.	Data Collection.
2.	Data Pre-Processing.
3.	Data Visualization.
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis.
5.	Feature Engineering.
6.	Model Selection, Training And Evaluation.
7.	Hyperparameter Tuning.
8.	Recommendations.


# Conclusion:

•	This project successfully developed a Random Forest model to predict YouTube video views, which achieved an RMSE of 0.8622 and R² of 0.5940 after hyperparameter tuning.

•	The model highlights the importance of viewer engagement (likes) as the primary driver of views.

•	While the model provides actionable insights for content creators and marketers, future work could enhance performance by incorporating additional features, improving category encoding, and addressing imputation biases.
